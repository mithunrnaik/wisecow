This repository contains a project that demonstrates containerization, secure deployment, and CI/CD automation for a sample web application using Docker, Kubernetes (Minikube), and GitHub Actions.

It also includes two utility scripts:

- `health_check.sh`: Monitors system health and logs alerts

- `log_file_analyzer.sh`: Analyzes web server logs for common patterns
